# Background

After a long research and struggle through going back-and-forth various research papers, idea of creating the list of the most optimal skills using realiable dataset just came to my mind.

### The questions I wanted to answer are these:

1. What are the top-paying Data Jobs?
2. What skills are required for these jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for these jobs?
4. Which skills are associated with the top-paying jobs?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

To dive deep into the data, I used all the potential of the following tools:

- **SQL:** the backbone of the analysis. I used different queries to find insights out of the raw data.
- **PostreSQL:** Thought of the most optimal database system to use in this project.
- **Visual Studio Code:** The code writing tool that I used to manage my database and run queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Chosen version control system and and the most optimal platform to share worldwide and manage project tracking.
